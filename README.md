## AI-Project: Decision Tree Learning -- Group 7
This part contains 
* dividing the dataset into **test** and **training** set 
* training the DTL model with **pruning**, **without pruning** and **depth pruning**
* **compairing** the three Decision tree on the test set. 

### Installation
git clone the repository. 

### Running the program
* Run the program in [VisualStudio IDE](https://www.visualstudio.com/)
* In the terminal navigate to the directory where the project is installed. 
* From here naviate to the folder `DecisionTreeLearning-G7\\DecisionTreeLearning-G7\\bin\\Realease`
* On reching this file path you'll see the execution file ` DecisionTreeLearning-G7.exe`. 
* Use this commandline to see the acccuracy of the trees. `DecisionTreeLeaning.exe monk.json monk.txt`
* You then use different arguments for testing accuracy of files you want to run test for. eg for spect dataset, it will be `DecisionTreeLeaning.exe spect.json spect.txt`

**Note** : the file path style is that of Windows OS
